<p>Regulating the new kid on the block.  Blockchain promises to be the
next big thing, revolutionizing business and technology as we know
it. It helps decentralize trust which in turn will reduce a lot of
hiccups in industries such as healthcare, logistics and the global
banking industry. The problem child of this technology seems to the
birth of numerous cryptocurrencies born out of this cutting edge
tech. Bitcoin - the poster boy of the crypto market has tumbled down
after a historic rally, many associate the fall with the idea that it
was a bubble and it had no intrinsic value, others argue that the
futures contract by Wall Street on bitcoin have kept the prices on
check.  The main concerns everywhere are based on evidence suggesting
crypto currencies are being used for criminal activities such as drugs
and weapons trade and financial crimes like money laundering and tax
evasion. Leaders from around the world met at Davos for the World
Economic Forum and hinted on tougher regulations to come into
effect. British Prime Minister Theresa May, in her interview with
Bloomberg stated that cryptocurrencies needs to be regulated due to
its potential in aiding criminal activities around the globe. This
only suggests that thisx will be tabled as an important agenda in the
G20 summit which is soon to see the light of day in Argentina few
months from now.</p>
<p>China was the first to come down hard on the crypto market by forcing
companies involved in crypto mining to shut down resulting in many
companies relocating, rightfully so, as the Chinese want absolutely no
uncertainty regarding their economy and its natural policy to monitor
everything that can be monitored. China was the best place for miners
due to the marginal cost of energy. This has resulted in companies
moving to Russia to continue the trade. Russia according to popular
public sources are considering a ban on the entire trade in the coming
months. Meanwhile, India has introduced its first act of regulating
the trade by letting the Income Tax department study the transactions
of the popular exchanges and then by asking investors to pay taxes on
capital gains if invested in the crypto market.  South Korea has made
its move by making it mandatory for investors to trade in their real
names and, will thus follow the KYC policies of banks. Japan too has
followed by introducing broad checks on exchanges after the recent
hack on one of its popular exchange which bore losses of over $500
million.</p>
<p>The economic problem behind cryptocurrencies have been debated across
several forums and many traditional investors have outright said they
want nothing to do with bitcoins and the crypto market. Problems with
regulating cryptocurrencies primarily arises from the fact that there
exists no single platform which brings together Blockchain experts,
economists, bankers and policy makers. Vitalik Buterin, who developed
Ethereum has tried to bring along many experts into the domain in
recent times by publicizing the idea of crypto economics but the
hostility towards crypto by governments keep prominent members from
academia disinterested in the cause. Even though Smart Contracts exist
from as early as 2006 the technology is very new and there is shortage
of experienced programmers. There needs to be a huge contribution in
this regard as financial technology needs to be blended with economics
for it to be adapted among the masses. Many economists are wary of the
idea since they suggesta limited number of bitcoins can never be used
by people around the world not to mention the extreme volatility of
these currencies. The fact that ultimately cryptos are being purchased
using fiat currencies again confuses investors. Few experts also
suggest that the surge in the prices was mainly due to the FOMO (Fear
of Missing Out) among young investors. To base a value of a currency
purely just on demand and supply also seems to be a nightmare to
traditional investors. Another important issue policy makers and
bankers point out is the completely unregulated process of ICOs
(Initial Coin Offering) as opposed to traditional methods. Tokens are
offered from just about anyplace with an internet connection. Most of
these ICOs eventually turn out to be scams. These problems make it the
need of the hour for experts from different domains to come together
to figure a coherent strategy to rationally implement a technology
which can very well help change the lives of billions of people across
the globe.</p>
