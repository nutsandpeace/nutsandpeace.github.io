With cryptos, Hamlet rightfully  asks : To be, or not  be; that is the
question :
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I write this only out of my  own understanding of the market as I have
been following  it from over  a year now. I  began my research  in the
area  for  my master’s  dissertation  that  was  due, I  took  extreme
interest in  this because it  coincided with financial  technology and
economics at  large.  
(&lt;i&gt;For  people curious about  what happened  to my
dissertation please read on after the end of the article&lt;/i&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-1"&gt;To Be:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The best aspects of crypto come from  the fact that it is based out of
the cryptographic system of Blockchain technology.  They are;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-1"&gt;Decentralised/  Distributed   Ledger&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A  ledger  is   nothing  but  a bookkeeping tool  in accounting,  
where all transactions  are recorded 
and stored, Ledgers used to be paper  records back in the day but when
computers   came  along   with   spreadsheets,  ledgers   are  now   a
database.  This  database,  distributed across  various  participants/
users across a network on the  internet is a distributed ledger. Users
across the world  save, synchronise and share the  information on this
ledger which make every user a witness to the transactions.These users
form what is called a ‘Node’.  These nodes don’t communicate with each
other  through  a central  system  rather,  each  of these  nodes  are
independent, decentralised  and has  a copy  of the  blockchain. These
nodes then form a ‘Block’ and each block has a cryptographic hash from
the previous block and this forms what we call a Blockchain.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Note: For  a Layman, This  database is managed by  all the users  in a
peer to peer network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-2"&gt;Eliminates Middlemen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As seen  from the previous  point, there  is no
central authority needed to validate transactions, the folks who stand
to lose  the most  from this  disruption would be  the likes  of VISA,
Mastercard  and other  payment gateways  as they  would become  nearly
obsolete  with the  intervention of  blockchain and  the decentralised
ledger system.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-3"&gt;Geographic advantage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This, I must say, is where its application would
really be of value. While I  was studying abroad, the biggest pain was
having money transferred from home to my bank account, it would easily
take  at   least  24  hours  if   not  more  to  get   it  transferred
internationally. Considering there were no bank holidays. Cryptos make
it possible to move money anywhere  across the world within 20 minutes
or so,  as long you have  an internet connection and  a digital wallet
of course.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-4"&gt;Less transaction cost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eliminating middlemen automatically means there
are  no  hidden   costs  or  extra  transaction   costs  for  services
provided. This area is where banks and payment gateways make a killing
in terms of their profits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-1-5" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-1-5"&gt;You own it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your crypto wallet is  owned and operated by  no one else
apart  from you  and  thus, you’re  responsible  for all  transactions
performed. This  is both an advantage  and a disadvantage as  we shall
see later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The markets never close: Gordon  Gekko famously said That ‘MONEY NEVER
SLEEPS’. The crypto market is like  the stock markets on cocaine. When
you  trade in  the markets  all stock  markets having  an opening  and
closing time. With cryptos you can trade for as long as you lose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sec-2"&gt;Not to be&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-1"&gt;Volatility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You don’t have to be  the Oracle of Omaha to have figured
out  the crazy  price swings  on  a day  to  day basis  in the  crypto
trade. These swings  are unsustainable in the long  run, investors who
are very bullish  and who have the hang of  intraday trading will find
it the best playground but if you are a value investor and haven’t got
the time to look at your screen  day in and day out, then I’d suggest,
you  find  alternative  source  of investments.The  story  of  anxious
bitcoin investors  is not a myth  guys! such price swings  make anyone
even just following these markets anxious let alone having invested in
it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-2"&gt;Demand and  Supply Seriously?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The  main determinant of any  market is
demand and supply, even for stock markets in that regard. When we talk
about a  stock market we  are talking about multiple  companies across
multiple sectors  all over  a country. That  is very  well diversified
into  the entire  economy.  When  we talk  about  crypto  what does  a
currency truly  offer when most investors  are buying it only  to make
money  out of  its volatility.  Also, the  argument that  bitcoins are
valuable because  their limited in  number is ridiculous.  That’s like
saying I buy a  car from ford because they make only  X number of cars
per year, while I can clearly  buy from any other car manufacturer. So
where is the  lack of demand of  a product when you  have thousands of
cryptocurrencies to choose from.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-3"&gt;Intrinsic value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Intrinsic value means  actual value or a  real value,
this term has been used even by philosophers suggesting its importance
in morality and  ethical decision making. In finance  however, this is
done by discounting  its future cash flows to its  present value. With
tangible things  like gold we  always have high intrinsic  value, with
intangibles this  gets tricky. When  you own  an equity what  gives it
value is that you  own part of an institution, and  the way that works
in the stock markets is that you get annual dividends and interests on
your holdings.  With cryptos  there is no  interest and  dividends the
price of a crypto is determined solely, by what another guy is willing
to pay for it.  These currencies at the end of the  day are bought and
sold  with different  fiat  currencies  and so  by  itself  it has  no
value. Sure, miners work hard and solve cryptographic problems to mine
these coins but that can not really be valued monetarily.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Regulation: Read my previous article.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-4"&gt;Speed and Scalability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In an interview J.P Morgan’s  infamous (in the
 crypto world) CEO Jamie Dimon said that there is a delay in executing
 trades with blockchain,  it takes anywhere between 12  and 20 minutes
 to execute a  trade here while present systems  execute equity trades
 within a fraction  of a second. Will we see  the entire population of
 the world using  one single cryptocurrency? Very  Highly unlikely. So
 the sheer  scale of people and  operations that it needs  to cater is
 too large for it to sustain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-5" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-5"&gt;Gone  forever&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-5"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The  ‘would  have’  been  millionaires.  The  biggest
disadvantage in this  system is that once you lose  your wallet, let’s
say you forgot your password or any issue like that. Once you lose it,
Puff, its gone and there is nothing you can do about it.  Remember the
advantage no  5. You own  it, Now if you  transfer funds to  the wrong
account  or   you  transfer  more   than  what  you  had   to,  you’re
screwed.  There  is no  way  to  reverse  the transaction  other  than
requesting the owner of the account and if that owner refuses there is
nothing you  can do to  claim your money back.  But with banks  we can
reverse payments etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-6" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-6"&gt;The whales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-6"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There emerged reports about how 40% of bitcoins were owned
by a handful of people. Also to  be taken into account is that Satoshi
Nakamoto owns about  1 million bitcoins these whales  can become major
market disruptors if they start to sell even small proportion of their
holdings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-7" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-7"&gt;Lets talk Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-7"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The blockchain in itself is a highly secure system
and  its hard  to  manipulate. With  the  trading in  cryptocurrencies
however, the  same can not  be said.  Many exchanges have  been hacked
across the world with millions  of bitcoins and other currencies being
stolen. Millions of  dollars have been wiped out  from these exchanges
and  only a  very  few  of the  exchanges  have  paid their  customers
back. These  hacks are very hard  to investigate giving the  nature of
anonymity of the currency. Your Digital  wallet can still be hacked is
your personal  computer is hacked. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="outline-container-sec-2-8" class="outline-3"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sec-2-8"&gt;Too good to be true&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I guess  a story where the common men outsmart a
system is  fantastic. Bitcoin promised just  that- anonymity. Bitcoins
was primarily used  in Silkroad before it shot to  fame last year. The
anonymity  though is  a blessing  to  many, most  investors prefer  to
remain known and  want to disclose their  investments and transactions
to   authorities.  These   investors   are  staying   away  from   the
trade. Bitcoin  investors have no one  to seek advice from  as Satoshi
Nakamoto is anonymous.  Ethereum led by Vitalik Buterin  is a blessing
to  the   industry  as  he   and  his  company  have   become  visible
personalities for people to talk, interact and learn about the endless
possibly this technology can offer.  To believe that the crypto market
will take power  away from governments and will let  people decide the
fate  of an  economy is  genuinely  a story  that  is too  good to  be
true. People elected to be in power are there for a reason and central
banks exist to  keep a close eye  on how a country’s  economy holds up
and don’t  entertain any kind of  uncertainty that puts the  system at
risk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In conclusion,  Be the master  of your fate,  and the captain  of your
soul. Do what you want and whatever makes you happy because none of us
know what we are talking about.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The dissertation story&lt;/b&gt;  After months of research  whilst I explained
the whole thing to my Supervisor I understood that this technology was
clearly not for everyone. After  pitching my dissertation proposal for
about 1 hour:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Supervisor:  “This Block  thing that  you  talk about,  are there  any
research papers by notable authors on this?”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(*Me in my mind:  Are you F!#$ing Kidding me! you  called it the Block
thing! After 1 hour of me saying Blockchain Technology and my research
proposal with that heading right in front of your face!*)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Me: “There are few sir, not many  though, it is a field where there is
a lot of research  as we speak there are a lot  of articles by experts
on the field and a paper from the World Economic Forum.”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Supervisor: “ I don’t think that would be credible enough please check
for more resources or I’d suggest you change your topic”
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And so ladies and gentlemen I had  to change my topic 2 more times and
wrote my dissertation on  Corporate governance which was uninteresting
when compared with Blockchain technology.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://nutsandpeace.github.io/posts/with-cryptos-hamlet-rightfully-asks-to-be-or-not-to-be/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 17:39:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Regulating the new kid on the 'Block'</title><link>https://nutsandpeace.github.io/posts/regulating-the-new-kid-on-the-block/</link><dc:creator>Vishnu Menon</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;
Blockchain promises to be the next big thing, revolutionizing business
and technology  as we know  it. It  helps decentralize trust  which in
turn will  reduce a lot of  hiccups in industries such  as healthcare,
logistics and the global banking  industry.  The problem child of this
technology seems to the birth of numerous cryptocurrencies born out of
this cutting edge tech. Bitcoin -  the poster boy of the crypto market
has tumbled down after a historic  rally, many associate the fall with
the idea that  it was a bubble  and it had no  intrinsic value, others
argue that  the futures contract by  Wall Street on bitcoin  have kept
the  prices on  check.   The  main concerns  everywhere  are based  on
evidence  suggesting cryptograms  are being  used for  criminal
activities such as  drugs and weapons trade and  financial crimes like
money laundering and tax evasion. Leaders from around the world met at
Davos for the  World Economic Forum and hinted  on tougher regulations
to  come into  effect.  British  Prime Minister  Theresa  May, in  her
interview  with Bloomberg  stated  that cryptocurrencies  needs to  be
regulated due  to its potential  in aiding criminal  activities around
the globe. This only suggests that this will be tabled as an important
agenda in  the G20 summit  which is  soon to see  the light of  day in
Argentina few months from now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
China was the first to come down  hard on the crypto market by forcing
companies involved  in crypto  mining to shut  down resulting  in many
companies relocating, rightfully so, as the Chinese want absolutely no
uncertainty regarding their economy and  its natural policy to monitor
everything that can be monitored. China  was the best place for miners
due to  the marginal cost of  energy.  This has resulted  in companies
moving to  Russia to continue  the trade. Russia according  to popular
public sources are considering a ban on the entire trade in the coming
months. Meanwhile,  India has introduced  its first act  of regulating
the trade by letting the  Income Tax department study the transactions
of the popular exchanges and then  by asking investors to pay taxes on
capital gains if  invested in the crypto market. South  Korea has made
its move by  making it mandatory for investors to  trade in their real
names and, will thus follow the  KYC policies of banks.  Japan too has
followed by  introducing broad  checks on  exchanges after  the recent
hack on  one of its  popular exchange which  bore losses of  over $500
million.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The economic problem behind  cryptocurrencies have been debated across
several forums and many traditional  investors have outright said they
want nothing to do with bitcoins  and the crypto market. Problems with
regulating cryptocurrencies primarily arises  from the fact that there
exists no  single platform  which brings together  Blockchain experts,
economists, bankers and policy makers.  Vitalik Buterin, who developed
Ethereum has  tried to  bring along  many experts  into the  domain in
recent  times by  publicizing the  idea  of crypto  economics but  the
hostility towards  crypto by  governments keep prominent  members from
academia disinterested in the cause. Even though Smart Contracts exist
from as early as 2006 the technology is very new and there is shortage
of experienced programmers.  There needs to be a  huge contribution in
this regard as financial technology needs to be blended with economics
for it to be adapted among the masses. Many economists are wary of the
idea since they suggesta limited number  of bitcoins can never be used
by people  around the world not  to mention the extreme  volatility of
these currencies. The fact that ultimately cryptos are being purchased
using  fiat  currencies again  confuses  investors.  Few experts  also
suggest that the surge in the prices  was mainly due to the FOMO (Fear
of Missing Out)  among young investors. To base a  value of a currency
purely  just on  demand and  supply also  seems to  be a  nightmare to
traditional  investors.  Another  important  issue  policy makers  and
bankers  point  out is  the  completely  unregulated process  of  ICOs
(Initial Coin Offering) as opposed to traditional methods.  Tokens are
offered from just about anyplace  with an internet connection. Most of
these ICOs eventually turn out to be scams. These problems make it the
need of the  hour for experts from different domains  to come together
to figure  a coherent  strategy to  rationally implement  a technology
which can very well help change the lives of billions of people across
the globe.
